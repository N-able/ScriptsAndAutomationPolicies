Version History

2.37  - Addressed an issue where the script was erroneously reporting that SentinelOne "Virus Scanning Enabled" was disabled.
2.36  - Added support for Bitdefender Endpoint Security Tools and Carbon Black Cloud. Fixed an issue where the script was truncating the first number of the SentinelOne version string.
2.35  - Refined how the script detect S1, so that it can now distinguish between an S1 install that is managed through SolarWinds, vs an install that is not. Addressed an issue where the script wasn't properly detecting whether or not Panda Adaptive Defense was up-to-date.
2.34  - Updated the script to properly handle date comparisons when devices are running Kaspersky Endpoint Security and are in Belgium. Tweaked the script to detect "SCEP Managed Defender" separately from Microsoft SCEP. The script now reports "SolarWinds EDR" when S1 is found, instead of calling it "SentinelOne". Addressed a bug where the script wasn't reporting on the version of SolarWinds EDR that was installed on the device. Added support for Trend Micro Apex One Security.
2.33  - Updated the script to properly handle date comparisons when devices are running Kaspersky Endpoint Security and are in Germany or the Netherlands. Updated the script to detect FireEye Endpoint Security and SentinelOne.

Updated how the script monitors Palo Alto Traps so that it correctly obtains the product version; detecting when Palo Alto Traps is running older A/V definitions is still unsupported. Added support for Panda Adaptive Defence 360. Updated the script to use a global %ProgramData% variable, instead of calling it separately in different parts of the code. Moved detection of SCEP to happen before Cisco AMP, to avoid issues with partially uninstalled versions of Cisco AMP.
2.31  - Fixed an issue where some permutations of Microsoft SCEP installs weren't being detected, due to the changes made in v2.30 of the script. Fixed a logic flaw that was impacting Trend Micro monitoring. Fixed an order-of-operations problem that prevented the script from properly detecting Vipre Business Agent.
2.30  - Added support for Sophos for Virtual Environments and Sophos Endpoint Protection. Added detection (but not yet monitoring) for Palo Alto Networks Traps™. Tweaked how the script detects Microsoft SCEP, so that it properly monitors SCEP-managed installs of Windows Defender. Fixed an issue that was causing the script to crash when trying to monitor F-Secure.
2.29  - Updated the script to work with date format modifications that Kaspersky and AVG have made in their logs. Addressed an issue where the script was crashing when trying to monitor McAffee ENS 10.6.
2.28  - Moved the detection of Microsoft Security Essentials to be "last", as it was being found before other 3rd party AV products. Added support for detecting Cisco AMP. Fixed an issue where Microsoft Defender was not being detected on Server-class operating systems.

2.22  - Added support for Norman Anti-Virus and for Kaspersky 10 SP2. Updated how the script determines if Kaspersky AV has virus scanning enabled. Fixed a bug where the script would state that Sophos was up-to-date, even if it was out-of-date. Fixed a bug where the script wasn't properly querying the root\SecurityCenter2 WMI namespace (foolishly created by my last fix in this area)
2.21  - Refined how the script detects AV Defender; in some cases it was detecting that AVD was installed because there was a folder left behind on the file system. Fixed an issue with how the script was detecting the presence or absense of data in WMI. Fixed a problem with how the script detects AV in the root\SecurityCenter2 WMI namespace.
2.20  - Added support for ESET Endpoint Security.
2.19  - Added support for Cylance PROTECT and ESET Mail Security. Fixed an issue where the service falsely reported a Failed status when ESET detected that the OS was missing patches, or that the license for ESET was going to expire in the near future. Fixed an issue with AV Defender detection.
2.18  - Completely re-wrote how the script monitors Sophos AV, based on some updated code snippets from a Sales Engineer at Sophos. Fixed a problem with Kaspersky monitoring where the script would exit with a "Kaspersky Ux file not found" error message. Added support for ESET's File Security product.
2.17  - Added support for Vipre Business Online 6.x. Fixed an issue with Avast! monitoring where the version number wasn't getting pushing to WMI.

2.12  - Fixed an issue where the script was terminating if the root\SecurityCenter2 namespace existed, but the AntiVirusProduct WMI class did not exist. Updated how the script detects F-Secure. Added support for AVG Protection. Fixed an issue where the script was throwing an exception when monitoring the latest version of Kaspersky 10.x.
2.11  - Fixed an issue where the script wouldn't detect Windows Defender if there were no entries in the root\SecurityCenter2 WMI namespace. Added support for Trend Micro Deep Security. 
2.10  - The "When was the script last run" metric is now formatted to use a consistent date format, regardless of the local of the device. Updated how the script detects whether or not Trend products are up-to-date or not. Fixed several issues with how the script detects and monitors Sophos
2.9   - Updated how the script detects Microsoft's SCEP product - thanks to Steve Moore for the help! Also fixed a bug where the script wouldn't properly detect if the WMI namespace/class already existed, which sometimes led to old information getting left in WMI.
